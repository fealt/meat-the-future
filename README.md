## Project Description

Let's refresh some important history facts about climate change.

```

▫️ In 1896, a seminal paper by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first predicted that changes
in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could substantially alter the surface temperature through
the greenhouse effect.

▫️ In 1938, Guy Callendar connected carbon dioxide increases in Earth’s atmosphere to global
warming.

▫️ In 1956, Gilbert Plass formulated the Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climate Change.

▫️ The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.18 degrees Celsius since the
late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the
atmosphere and other human activities.

▫️ Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being
the warmest.

▫️ The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.
